# 4 Frames <sup><sub>Prototype</sup></sub>

Guess the movie web game using up to 4 frames as a clue.

The main functionality is developed and represents a prototype of the experience, so it is programmed as a static page using native web technologies: `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`.

This game was designed as an activity for the course **Web Development in Client Environment**.
